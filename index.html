      <!-- Intro Bio -->
      <!-- This section should be inline with the profile photo on the left, with
      the text to its right. -->
      <span>
      <p>
        As a visual and musical artist, my experience largely revolves around
        the creative process, collaborative projects, and expression through
        multiple mediums. As a formally trained audio engineer, I also learned
        to embrace the technical concepts of the creative process, and to
        systematically and quickly troubleshoot errors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Combining an artistic perspective with technical proficiency, commercial
        photography became my next passion. Creating alongside other artists
        provided an avenue for one-of-a-kind expressive imagery, recognized by
        international publications and awards. The desire to create, regardless
        of medium, is an engrained trait for self expression, as well as the
        need to inspire, invoke emotion and promote thought in the audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, my newest challenge as a computer science student is learning to
        channel my creativity into a new medium to help other artists more
        freely express themselves. For example, as a musician and audio
        engineer, I am aware of technological limitations and steep learning
        curves. As a commercial fashion photographer, I experienced the
        inefficiencies of disorganized camera menu systems or poorly written
        code for bridging professional camera systems wirelessly to mobile
        phones. Artists wish to create, not to spend their valuable
        time troubleshooting technical difficulties. Therefore, my aspiration is
        to create or improve the digital mediums that artists use to make them
        more user friendly, intuitive and reliable in high stress situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a passion project, I would like to give back to the vegan/plant-based
        community using my newly acquired technical skills. Since making the
        change to the green (vegan) side in 2012, my life has positively
        changed, given me a deeper love for all sentient beings, and a profound
        respect for the planet. Whether I help entrepreneur vegan organziations
        launch websites or apps, I would like to lend my skills to help unite
        like minds and peacefully spread the message of living a cruelty-free lifestyle
        to others who are receptive.
