    <p>As a visual and musical artist, my experience largely revolves around the creative process, collaborative projects, and expression through multiple mediums. As a formally trained audio engineer, I also learned to embrace the technical concepts of the creative process, and to systematically and quickly troubleshoot errors.</p>
    <p>Combining an artistic perspective with technical proficiency, commercial photography became my next passion. Creating alongside other artists provided an avenue for one-of-a-kind expressive imagery, recognized by international publications and awards. The desire to create, regardless of medium, is an engrained trait for self expression, as well as the need to inspire, invoke emotion and promote thought in the audience.</p>
    <p>Now, my newest challenge as a computer science student is learning to channel my creativity into a new medium to help other artists more freely express themselves. For example, as a musician and audio engineer, I am aware of technological limitations and steep learning curves. As a commercial fashion photographer, I experienced the inefficiencies of disorganized camera menu systems or poorly written code for bridging professional camera systems wirelessly to mobile phones, for example. Artists wish to create, not to spend their valuable time troubleshooting technical difficulties. Therefore, my aspiration is to create or improve the digital mediums that artists use to make them more user friendly, intuitive and reliable in high stress situations.</p>
    <p>As a passion project, I would like to give back to the vegan/plant-based community using my newly acquired technical skills. Since making the change to the green (vegan) side in 2012, my life has positively changed, given me a deeper love for all sentient beings, and a profound respect for the planet. Whether I help entrepreneur vegan organziations launch websites or apps, I would like to lend my skills to help unite like minds and peacefully spread the message to others who are receptive.</p>
